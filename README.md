# COVID Interventions

This is a listing (with links where possible) of interventions for COVID.

# Healthy

Healthy individuals not yet exposed.

* can we prevent infection
  * vaccination

    * [Stat news vaccine tracker](https://www.statnews.com/feature/coronavirus/drugs-vaccines-tracker/)
    * [BioRender Vaccine Tracker](https://biorender.com/covid-vaccine-tracker))
    * [NY Times Vaccine Tracker](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html)
 
* what can reduce healthy patients from being exposed 
  * [WHO guidance](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public)
  * [CDC guidance for higher risk patients](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html)

* are there safer times to be exposed?

# Exposed

* what can be done to prevent exposed patients from becoming infected? 
  * [What to do if you have been exposed from Harvard Health](https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/if-youve-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus)

# Infected

* what can be done to prevent progression?
  * [Therapeutics](https://covidprotocols.org/protocols/therapeutics/)
* what can be done to reduce infection?

# Sick

* what can be done at home to prevent progression?
  * [Therapeutics](https://covidprotocols.org/protocols/therapeutics/)

# Very sick

* can very sick patients be treated at home?
  * In overwhelmed systems (such as Italy, there was [a request to treat more patients at home](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/21/coronavirus-plea-from-italy-treat-patients-at-home/)), and while there are [protocols emerging to manage patients who are not very sick at home](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7062433/), when there is hospital capacity it is not clear that very sick patients can be cared for safely at home without reproducing a hospital level of care. 

* goals of care - are patients wishes about what they would like to have happen **known** and **honoured**?
  * [Pallicovid has video simulations of having conversations about goals of care and code status](https://pallicovid.app/section/1554)

# ED

* best initial care of patients
  * [Ambulatory and ED management](https://covidprotocols.org/protocols/ambulatory-ed-and-floor-management/)
* rapid and safe diagnosis
  * [Diagnostics for Covid](https://covidprotocols.org/protocols/diagnostics/)

# Hospital

* best treatments to prevent progression in patients
  * [Therapeutics](https://covidprotocols.org/protocols/therapeutics/)

# ICU

* best treatments for critically ill patients
  * [Critical care management](https://covidprotocols.org/protocols/critical-care/)

# Ventilator

* Best ventilator strategies
  * [Respiratory management](https://covidprotocols.org/protocols/respiratory/#initial-mechanical-ventilation)
* Multiple patients per ventilators
* Ventilator manufacture

# Recovery

* Are they immune? Possibly - but might wane (we don't know the timing yet)
* Can I test if I am immune? [Serological testing](https://www.covidambulatory.org/index.php?title=Testing_and_Diagnosis#Serologic_testing)
* [Donating serum](https://www.covidambulatory.org/index.php?title=Care_of_the_COVID%2B_outpatient#Convalescent_plasma_donation) - can your antibodies save others?
